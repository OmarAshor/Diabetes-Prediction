# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This Python script utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict diabetes based on certain medical attributes. The dataset used in this script contains information about patients, including features like glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, age, etc.

## Instructions
1. **Installation**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```
2. **Dataset**: The dataset used in this script is stored in a CSV file named `diabetes.csv`. Make sure this file is located in the same directory as the script or specify the correct file path.

3. **Code Execution**: Run the script in a Python environment. It will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train an SVM model, and then predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on the input data.

4. **Output**: The script will output the accuracy scores for both the training and test datasets. Additionally, it will make a prediction based on the input data provided at the end of the script.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
